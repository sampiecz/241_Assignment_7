This program is just the creation of a linked stack ADT.

Assign7.cpp is the driver program, and Stack.h is what I wrote.

Clone repo and cd into dir. Then run make.  Then ./assign7 to run.

I ran "./assign7 | cat > answers" to check answers teacher provided.

Output and answers file can be checked with "diff output answers".
